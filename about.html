                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses, has a long history that dates back to ancient times. The game is believed to have originated in ancient Egypt around 1300 BCE, where a similar game was played on a grid drawn in the sand. It evolved over time and spread across different cultures. In ancient Rome, a game called "Terni Lapilli," played on a grid, had similar rules, though players used pebbles instead of X's and O's. The modern version of tic-tac-toe, as we know it today, gained popularity in the 19th century, particularly in the United States and Europe. By the 20th century, tic-tac-toe became a widely recognized children's game, often played on paper or chalkboards. Its simplicity and quick play have made it a timeless pastime, enjoyed by generations across the world. With the advent of digital games, tic-tac-toe found new life in the form of video games, further cementing its place in popular culture.</p>
